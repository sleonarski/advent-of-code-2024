Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.

Or are they?

The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes or how to read most of the Chief's handwriting,
but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs appear in both lists!
Maybe the other numbers aren't location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.

This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list.
Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying
it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.

Here are the same example lists again:

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

    The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
    The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
    The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
    The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
    The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
    The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.

So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).

Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?

# Day2

## Part One
The unusual data (your puzzle input) consists of many reports, one report per line. Each report is a list of numbers called levels that are separated by spaces. For example:

7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9

This example data contains six reports each containing five levels.

The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually
increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

    The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
    Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.

In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:

    7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.
    1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.
    9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.
    1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.
    8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.
    1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.

So, in this example, 2 reports are safe.

Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. How many reports are safe?

## Part Two

The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell you about the Problem Dampener.

The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single bad level in what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened!

Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as safe.

More of the above example's reports are now safe:

    7 6 4 2 1: Safe without removing any level.
    1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
    9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
    1 3 2 4 5: Safe by removing the second level, 3.
    8 6 4 4 1: Safe by removing the third level, 4.
    1 3 6 7 9: Safe without removing any level.

Thanks to the Problem Dampener, 4 reports are actually safe!

Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports. How many reports are now safe?
